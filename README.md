I‚Äôm Bharat Mehra, a dedicated and versatile Game Developer with over 5 years of industry experience creating interactive, meaningful, and technically sound games.

I‚Äôve always believed that games are one of the most powerful mediums for storytelling, emotional expression, and player connection. What started as a hobby ‚Äî playing and experimenting with mechanics ‚Äî turned into a passion for crafting entire worlds from scratch. I build games not just to entertain, but to communicate thoughts, challenge minds, and inspire curiosity.

My primary development engine is Unity, where I‚Äôve built and shipped multiple projects spanning multiplayer combat, procedural gameplay, music-integrated worlds, and mobile experiences. I'm also learning Unreal Engine to deepen my technical depth and broaden the genres and visual styles I can explore.

Whether it‚Äôs designing responsive AI, optimizing real-time performance, handling backend multiplayer architecture, or animating cinematic experiences with motion capture, I approach each task with a mindset of clarity, scalability, and immersion.

I also have experience in user behavior analysis and targeted feature design, which allows me to shape game mechanics based on what players enjoy most, increasing retention and emotional impact.

My career goal is to collaborate with various game studios, mastering different genres and development styles ‚Äî so I can continue to grow as a creative technologist and design truly unique experiences for players across the world.
